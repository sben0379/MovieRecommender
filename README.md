# Movie recommender
## Summary
This is my first project making use of NLP. Using Spacy's en_core_web_md module, the programme compares the inputted
movie description and checks it for semantic similarity against a small database of other movie descriptions. The
programme then returns the movie with the highest similarity. 
## Latest Update
### Version 0.1
* This is just a test of the NLP module's capabilities and doesn't contain user functionality yet.
* The NLP similarity module checks the given movie description of similarities with movies in the database.
## Planned Updates
* Add a GUI
* Allow user to input any movie description 
* Include a much larger database of movie descriptions for comparison
